# Memotion Analysis: Meme Sentiment Classification

## Abstract

This project delves into meme sentiment classification, employing machine learning and deep learning models to analyze and categorize sentiments expressed in meme content. The dataset comprises 6992 meme images sourced from Kaggle, providing a diverse collection with five distinct sentiment labels—Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, and Very Negative. The multilabel nature of the dataset allows for a nuanced understanding of sentiments, capturing a spectrum of emotions and opinions in the images.

## About Dataset

The dataset consists of 6992 meme images, each labeled with one or more of the sentiment categories—Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, and Very Negative. The dataset can be found on Kaggle, and you can access it through the [Memotion Dataset (7K)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/williamscott701/memotion-dataset-7k) link.

The "Text OCR" column contains raw Optical Character Recognition (OCR) output, and the "Text Corrected" column likely presents a version of the text that has been manually or automatically corrected for accuracy. The "Overall Sentiment" column is the target variable for sentiment analysis.
